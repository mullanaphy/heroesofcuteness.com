[Heroes of Cuteness](http://www.heroesofcuteness.com)
=============================================

Here's the source code for the comic series, Heroes of Cuteness. I'm not sure how helpful this might be, especially
since  I already have a more customizable codebase over at
[https://github.com/mullanaphy/boycottpaper](https://github.com/mullanaphy/boycottpaper) that tackles this problem, but
this one is at least in PHP with Symfony.

Please note, the source code is completely free to use while any and all actual content on the site is not based on this
license. This license gives you free use of the source code only.

How It Works
------------
